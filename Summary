**********************************************
              Summary

This project was designed to show how
bubble and merge sort can can be used to
sort pixels based on their rgb data. This 
project is especially useful at showing how
the original placement of values in an array
can affect the outcome of the sorted array
when there are duplicate values scattered 
throughout the data.

This was a submission for our Data Structures
and algorithms class.
